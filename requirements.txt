# Langflow Infrastructure Composer Dependencies
# 
# NOTE: langflow will install 500+ packages as it includes many optional integrations
# (LLM providers, vector databases, etc.). This is expected behavior for the full
# Langflow framework. If you need a minimal setup, consider using only the core
# components without the full Langflow UI.

# Core Framework (required for Component classes and Langflow UI)
langflow>=1.0.0

# AWS SDK (required for AWS operations)
boto3>=1.34.0
# botocore is automatically installed with boto3
lfx>=0.2.0
# Data Validation (required for Pydantic models)
pydantic>=2.0.0

# AWS Architecture Icons (optional, for AWS icon paths)
# aws-pdk>=0.26.0  # Uncomment if you want AWS icon support

# Template Engine (optional, for advanced Terraform generation)
# jinja2>=3.1.0  # Usually included with langflow, uncomment if needed
